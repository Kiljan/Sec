WiFuzz is a 802.11 protocol fuzzer. The tool uses Scapy and its fuzz() function to
send manipulated packets to an access point. With which one can configure which
protocols (Probe-Request, Association, Authentication, etc.) should get fuzzed.
The source code of the project can be found on the internet on code.google.com/
p/wifuzz/.




Pyrit (pyrit.googlecode.com) is a WPA/WPA2 brute force cracking tool. Its specialty
lies in fully utilizing all cores of a CPU and concurrently using the GPUs of graphic
cards for cracking, which increases the amount of probed keys per second from 40
(1.5 GHz single core cpu) up to 89,000. Optionally Pyrit can save precalculated keys
in a database to boost the cracking process again thus 99.9 % of the time is spend
for computing the key and only 0.1 % for comparing.



AirXploit (github.com/balle/airxploit) is an event-based exploit framework for
wireless networks. That means AirXploit searches for Wifi or Bluetooth nets and
as soon as it finds a new device an event gets generated which triggers one or more
plugins. The plugins operate on the new device and can execute such actions as
gathering information, trying to break in by exploit or in the case of a Wifi AP try
to crack the WEP key with the help of Aircrack-NG.
The framework is completely written in Python and can be extended with self-
hacked plugins. However the project is still in alpha state, which has to follow that
the WEP cracking code is not stable yet.
